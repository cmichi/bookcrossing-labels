# BookCrossing Labels

The idea behind this project is that most BookCrossing labels are very
generic. This a series of book-content-specific labels.

At the moment the labels are in German. 


## Pirates! Arrrr!

This label takes use of this icon: Skull and Crossbones by Ana Mar√≠a Lora Macias from The Noun Project.
